			<div class="title">A brief report on the Vedanta Vidvadgoshthi held at Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya, Holenarasipura, on March 5, 6, and 7, 2011.</div>
			<p>
				<b>Every day before 7.15 am:</b> Pooja to Digvijaya Ramachandra and at the Samadhi of Sri Sri Swami Satchidanandendra Saraswati was held.<br /><br />

The Goshthi was held from 7.30 am to about 6.30 pm on 5th and 6th, and from 7.30 am to 1 pm on 7th, with breaks for breakfast (9 am to 10 am) and lunch (1.30 pm to 3 pm). Tender coconut water, water melon juice, badam milk and water was served to all during the Goshthi itself. Dinner was served after 8 pm.<br /><br />

All the deliberations of the Goshthi were held using only Sanskrit language. Summary of discussions in Kannada language was given on all the three days after the Goshthi. About twenty Vidvans and Sanyasis participated in the Goshthi and around a hundred others witnessed it.<br /><br />

<b>On 05.03.11, Saturday: from 7.30 am:</b> Lighting of Lamp, Mangala Arati at Sri Sri Swami Satchidanandendra Saraswati’s Samadhi. General Welcome to Vidvans and all others and introducing the President Sri Swami Prakashanandendra Saraswati.<br /><br />

<b>Commencement of Goshthi :</b> The President initially set the rules to be followed during the discussion: presentation and discussion of topics to be done on the basis of prasthanatraya bhashyas and yukti alone; no digression to some other topic; should speak only as much as is necessary; essential meaning of the Bhashyas to be brought out etc. The President assured that everyone has full freedom to express personal opinion. However, opinion of others has to be respected and personal attacking, insulting etc., needs to be avoided. Those who present topics will take a maximum of twenty minutes, during which time no interjection by anyone. Later the topic will be discussed for a maximum of one hour. The president will summarise the discussion in ten minutes. The same procedure will be followed for all topics.<br /><br />

Sri Swami Advayanandendra Saraswathi who has guided all the activities related to the  Goshthi right from the beginning, over six months ago, said that the source of inspiration for all the activities of the Karyalaya and the present Goshthi is Sri Sri Swami Satchidanandendra Saraswati.<br /><br />

The two topics that were not discussed due to lack of time: Anvaya_vyatireka_lakṣaṇam – tarkasvarūpam and Māyā_svarūpam.<br /><br />

In general, the Goshthi was held in a cordial atmosphere. The music of the fluent Sanskrit spoken during discussions and other deliberations was a treat to the ears according to many.<br /><br />

A summary of the discussions on various topics would appear in the Commemoration Volume that will be published eventually. The following are some general observations:<br /><br />

It appears that the differences in the view points on several issues remain intact even after the Goshthi. Broadly, two differing viewpoints could be seen:<br /><br />

According to one view point moolavidya has to be taken as the cause of adhyasa; Then only it will be as per Bhashyas. The other view point is that as per Bhashyas, adhyasa is avidya and no cause for adhyasa should be posited. However, from both points of view, arriving at nishcaya jnana about Atmaswarupa is Vidya, and avidya is that which is removed by vidya. Differences in the interpretation of Bhshyas to support each view exist. The Goshthi witnessed lengthy discussions on interpreting Bhashya relating to ‘mahatah paramavyaktam’ and ‘avidya hi avyaktam’.<br /><br />

According to one view, if the cause of the world is taken as nirguna Brahman, it would not be proper. According to the other the Brahma Sutras say the opposite. According to both, however, the srushti prakriya is only to teach Atma-Brahma ekatva.<br /><br />

One view point is that adhyaropa-apavada prakriya should be applied only in relation to nirguna pratipadaka sruti vakyas. But according to the other view, the prakriya must be applied for all sruti vakyas.<br /><br />

There is avidya in sushupti. There is no avidya in sushupti;<br /><br />

ajnana is bhavarupa padartha. ajnana is jnana abhava; <br /><br />

Sakshi (Witness) cannot be considered to be a pramana. No, sakshi anubhava is very much there.<br /><br />

No prarabdha karma for jnani; the state of mukti is Brahman only (Brahmaiva hi muktyavasthaa); it is ajnanis prarabdha which makes them see jnani in body; sadyomukti or jivanmukti is the main mukti and this is at the same time of attaining samyakjnana/ avidyanivrutti; videhamukti is told only as courtesy (upacara); krama mukti is for upasakas; if avidya in sushupti is accepted then there will be no dristanta (illustration) for moksha; no avidyalesa for jnani; no prasankhyana (jnanabhyasa), etc., etc. These are according to one view. However these are not acceptable to others.<br /><br />

The concluding remarks at the end of discussions on each topic by Sri Swami Prakashanandendra Saraswathi were well balanced and were appreciated by all.<br /><br />

The Goshthi was concluded on 7th March by 1 pm. All the Vidvans were honoured with shawls, fruit basket and flowers. Honorariums and travel expenditure were also paid. The efforts of the Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya in holding the Vidvadgoshthi and the arrangements and hospitality were praised by many, without any reservations. Many hoped that such Vidvadgoshthis must happen frequently.<br /><br />
